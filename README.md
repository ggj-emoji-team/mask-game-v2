# EMOJI//MASK 
**Working Title**

GGJ team game project

## Game Concept
A rhythm-based emoji emotion combat game where emojis act as masks, weapons, and emotional identities.

Players hit rhythm nodes to activate emojis.
Activated emojis automatically attack boss dialogue bubbles to generate score.

## Core Mechanic
Rhythm-triggered emoji auto-combat system.

## Gameplay
- Music track starts
- Rhythm nodes fall
- Player hits nodes
- Emoji is activated
- Emoji auto-attacks dialogue bubbles
- Score increases
- Reach score threshold to clear stage

## Player Goal
Accumulate score through rhythm input, unlock emojis, clear all stages, and defeat the final boss.

## Game Loop
Enter stage  
→ Music starts  
→ Rhythm nodes fall  
→ Hit rhythm  
→ Emoji activated  
→ Auto-attack bubble  
→ Score increase  
→ Reach score threshold  
→ Clear stage  
→ Unlock emoji  
→ Next stage  

## Win Condition
Reach the required score threshold.

## Fail Condition
Emotion Overload Dual-Failure System:
- Too many unhandled dialogue bubbles  
- AND score below threshold  

## Theme Interpretation (MASK)
Emojis are emotional masks.
They express identity, emotion, and power.
Players trigger masks instead of directly attacking.
